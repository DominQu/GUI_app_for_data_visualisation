# GUI_app_for_data_visualisation

This is a student project. The task was to write a GUI app, which would show on a compass how a position of a robot changed. The data from the robot's sensor was saved in a text file.

### How the program works:

The app uses python tkinter module to create GUI app. In the app there are several buttons, with whom the user can choose: 

+ data from which axis to be shown (pitch, roll or yaw)
+ at what frequency the data should be shown
+ when to start or stop the animation
+ what number of starting values should be discarded (sensor at the beginnng outputs random noise)

### What I learned:

+ how to create a GUI app with Python
+ how to visualise sensoric data
+ OOP in Python
